Key Limitations of the Trash Can Placement Simulation:

1. Agent Behavior Simplifications:
- Agents use basic A* pathfinding without considering:
  * Dynamic obstacles
  * Crowd behavior/avoidance
  * Personal preferences
  * Real-world navigation challenges

2. Environmental Factors Missing:
- No terrain difficulty (all empty spaces equal)
- No weather/time-of-day effects
- No maintenance/accessibility considerations
- Walls DO block visibility (using line-of-sight checks)
- But other obstructions like furniture/vegetation not modeled

3. Static Garbage Can Placement:
- Cans don't move or change capacity
- No consideration of can maintenance/emptying
- Fixed locations throughout all simulation runs

4. Simplified Success Conditions:
- Binary success/failure (littered or not)
- No partial disposal attempts
- No varying garbage amounts
- No consideration of can fullness

5. Spatial/Temporal Limitations:
- 2D grid doesn't capture 3D reality
- No time-varying patterns (e.g. rush hours)
- Fixed map layout throughout simulation

6. Social Factors Missing:
- No peer influence effects
- No signage/education impact
- No enforcement presence
- No cultural/behavioral differences

Recommendations for Future Improvements:
- Add dynamic can properties (capacity, visibility)
- Incorporate more realistic agent decision-making
- Include time-varying patterns
- Add environmental effects
- Consider 3D navigation aspects
